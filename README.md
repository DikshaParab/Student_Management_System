Add Student: Register students with attributes like ID, name, age, and course.

View All Students: List every student currently in the system.

Search Student: Find and display a student's details using their ID.

Update Student: Modify the details of an existing student.

Delete Student: Remove a student's record from the system.

Exit: Terminate the application gracefully.
